# 🗓️ Development Timeline for Grid Monitoring & Simulation Tool

This document outlines a recommended phased development plan, starting from scratch and gradually building up the full-featured platform.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Project Setup

**Objectives:**
- Prepare environments
- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Define basic code structure

**Tasks:**
- Initialize Git repositories
- Dockerize frontend/backend
- Set up Postgres + TimescaleDB + Neo4j (local/dev)
- Create minimal CI/CD (build + test)
- Write basic README and contribution guides

---

## 🚧 Phase 1: Core Backend & Frontend Foundation (Week 3–5)

**Objectives:**
- Build the foundational backend services and UI scaffold

**Backend Features:**
- Auth system (JWT)
- Users & roles API
- Topology CRUD (Graph DB integration)
- Scenario management (SQL)

**Frontend Features:**
- Next.js scaffold with routing
- Auth pages (login, logout)
- Layout, sidebar, navigation shell
- Scenario list and detail view

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Network Topology Editor

**Objectives:**
- Provide tools to draw, edit and inspect network topology

**Features:**
- Cytoscape.js integration
- Node/edge creation and deletion
- Element property form (sidebar)
- Save/load to Graph DB
- Sync layout per scenario

---

## 📈 Phase 3: Simulation Engine & Scenario Execution

**Objectives:**
- Enable power flow simulations based on saved topologies

**Tasks:**
- Input builder (topology + SQL merge)
- Primitive power flow algorithm (AC or DC)
- Job queue with worker
- API: `POST /simulation/run`
- Results display in UI (voltages, flows)

---

## 🛰️ Phase 4: Real-Time Monitoring Layer

**Objectives:**
- Build live telemetry monitoring and alarm system

**Features:**
- WebSocket subscription model
- Telemetry storage (TimescaleDB)
- Telemetry viewer on network
- Alarm detection + visual overlay

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing, QA & Hardening

**Objectives:**
- Ensure reliability and robustness

**Tasks:**
- Unit tests, integration tests
- Performance tests on simulation engine
- Security checks and API validation
- Usability and bug fixing from internal feedback

---

## 🚀 Phase 6: Deployment & Production Launch

**Objectives:**
- Deploy to production and onboard real users

**Tasks:**
- Kubernetes setup + scaling policies
- Monitoring dashboards
- Logging + alerting setup
- SSL, domain, backup configuration

---

## 🔮 Phase 7: Extended Features & Roadmap (Post-MVP)

- Fault simulation & N-1 analysis
- Geographic visualization (map overlay)
- SCADA integration (IEC 104, OPC UA)
- Multi-user collaboration
- Export to CGMES / CSV
- OPF and dynamic simulation

---

## 📌 Notes
- Adjust timelines based on team size and parallelism
- Testing and documentation should be included in each phase
- Feature flags may be used for incremental rollout
